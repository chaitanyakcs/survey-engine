## Core Evaluation Framework Design

An effective evaluation framework for questionnaire generation must address multiple dimensions that capture both technical quality and business value. The framework should be **systematic, reproducible, and aligned with real-world usage patterns**

### Referenced Data Tables
- [QNR Scoring](QNR%20Scoring%202773fa14efa080e0b4a8f6dd4836405a.csv)
- [Quality Thresholds](Quality%20Thresholds%202773fa14efa080b899a2e28bb483df56.csv)
- [Weightage](Weightage%202773fa14efa0802e8620e2d5c64c7ab2.csv)

### Score Calculation:

Score for each pillar is calculated as sum of scores for each component and scaled to the pillar weight.

Comprehensive score is the sum of individual pillar scores

### Color themes

Out of a total max score applicable, <60% is Red, 60%-80% is Orange and >80% Green. The same coloring can be applied to both individual pillar and overall QNR

## Multi-Dimensional Evaluation Architecture

Your evaluation framework should encompass five primary dimensions:

**Quality Assessment Dimensions:**

- **Content Validity**: How well the questionnaire captures the intended research objectives and covers all necessary aspects of the topic
- **Methodological Rigor**: Adherence to market research best practices, including proper question sequencing, bias avoidance, and sampling considerations
- **Clarity and Comprehensibility**: Language accessibility, question wording effectiveness, and absence of ambiguous or double-barreled questions
- **Structural Coherence**: Logical flow, appropriate question types, and proper use of scales and response formats
- **Deployment Readiness**: Practical considerations like length, completion time, and stakeholder requirements alignment

## Establishing Evaluation Benchmarks

Create both **general benchmarks** that apply across all questionnaire types and **domain-specific benchmarks** tailored to particular industries or research contexts. Your benchmarks should include:

**Reference Standards:**

- High-quality questionnaires from your golden dataset rated by expert researchers
- Industry-standard questionnaires from established market research firms
- Validated academic instruments adapted for commercial research contexts

**Performance Baselines:**

- Human expert performance on the same tasks
- Current manual questionnaire development metrics (time, cost, quality scores)
- Competitor or alternative system performance where available

## 1. Content Validity

How well the questionnaire captures the intended research objectives and covers all necessary aspects of the topic

### Yes/No Questions:

1. **Does the questionnaire cover all essential aspects of the research objectives stated in the requirement document?**
2. **Are demographic questions appropriate and sufficient for the target audience analysis?**
3. **Does the questionnaire include validation or consistency check questions to verify response reliability?**
4. **Are all key stakeholder information needs addressed within the questionnaire?**
5. **Does the questionnaire avoid including irrelevant or off-topic questions?**
6. **Are industry-specific considerations and terminology appropriately incorporated?**

### Scaled Response Questions (Poor to Excellent):

1. **Rate the comprehensiveness of topic coverage relative to research objectives**
2. **Evaluate the alignment between questionnaire content and stated research goals**
3. **Assess the adequacy of demographic and classification questions for analysis needs**
4. **Rate the inclusion of necessary validation questions to ensure data quality**
5. **Evaluate how well the questionnaire addresses all stakeholder information requirements**

## 2. Methodological Rigor

Adherence to market research best practices, including proper question sequencing, bias avoidance, and sampling considerations

### Yes/No Questions:

1. **Are questions sequenced logically from general to specific topics?**
2. **Does the questionnaire avoid leading or biased question formulations?**
3. **Are appropriate scale types (Likert, ranking, categorical) used consistently throughout?**
4. **Does the questionnaire include proper screening questions to ensure qualified respondents?**
5. **Are sensitive questions positioned appropriately (toward the end) to minimize dropout?**
6. **Does the questionnaire follow established market research best practices for question construction?**

### Scaled Response Questions (Poor to Excellent):

1. **Rate the logical flow and sequence of questions throughout the questionnaire**
2. **Evaluate the appropriateness of scale types and response formats used**
3. **Assess the questionnaire's adherence to methodological standards for bias avoidance**
4. **Rate the effectiveness of screening and qualification questions**
5. **Evaluate the overall methodological soundness of the research design**

## 3. Clarity and Comprehensibility

Language accessibility, question wording effectiveness, and absence of ambiguous or double-barreled questions

### Yes/No Questions:

1. **Are all questions written in clear, simple language appropriate for the target audience?**
2. **Does the questionnaire avoid technical jargon or complex terminology without explanation?**
3. **Are question instructions clear and complete for each question type?**
4. **Does the questionnaire avoid double-barreled questions (asking multiple things at once)?**
5. **Are all response options mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive where appropriate?**
6. **Is the estimated completion time reasonable for the questionnaire length?**

### Scaled Response Questions (Poor to Excellent):

1. **Rate the clarity and understandability of question wording**
2. **Evaluate the appropriateness of language level for the target audience**
3. **Assess the completeness and clarity of instructions provided to respondents**
4. **Rate the absence of ambiguous or confusing question formulations**
5. **Evaluate the overall readability and user-friendliness of the questionnaire**

## 4. Structural Coherence

Logical flow, appropriate question types, and proper use of scales and response formats

### Yes/No Questions:

1. **Does the questionnaire have a clear introduction explaining its purpose and importance?**
2. **Are question blocks or sections organized thematically and logically?**
3. **Does the questionnaire include appropriate transition statements between major sections?**
4. **Are skip patterns and routing logic implemented correctly and clearly?**
5. **Does the questionnaire conclude with appropriate closing statements or thank you messages?**
6. **Are open-ended and closed-ended questions balanced appropriately for the research objectives?**

### Scaled Response Questions (Poor to Excellent):

1. **Rate the overall organization and structure of the questionnaire**
2. **Evaluate the logical grouping of related questions into coherent sections**
3. **Assess the effectiveness of transitions between different topic areas**
4. **Rate the appropriateness of question type variety and distribution**
5. **Evaluate the professional presentation and formatting of the questionnaire**

## 5. Deployment Readiness

Practical considerations like length, completion time, and stakeholder requirements alignment

### Yes/No Questions:

1. **Is the questionnaire length appropriate for the research objectives and target audience?**
2. **Does the questionnaire meet industry compliance and regulatory requirements?**
3. **Are data privacy and ethical considerations properly addressed in the questionnaire design?**
4. **Is the questionnaire technically compatible with intended distribution platforms?**
5. **Does the questionnaire include all necessary legal disclaimers and consent statements?**
6. **Are the resource requirements (time, cost, respondent burden) realistic for implementation?**

### Scaled Response Questions (Poor to Excellent):

1. **Rate the overall feasibility of implementing this questionnaire in the field**
2. **Evaluate the appropriateness of questionnaire length for target completion rates**
3. **Assess compliance with relevant industry standards and regulations**
4. **Rate the questionnaire's readiness for immediate deployment without modifications**
5. **Evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the questionnaire design for achieving research objectives**

## Composite Evaluation Framework

### Overall Quality Assessment:

**Summary Yes/No Questions:**

1. **Would you recommend this questionnaire for deployment without major revisions?**
2. **Does this questionnaire meet professional market research standards?**
3. **Would this questionnaire likely achieve the stated research objectives?**

**Summary Scaled Questions (Poor to Excellent):**

1. **Overall questionnaire quality compared to industry benchmarks**
2. **Likelihood of achieving reliable and valid research results**
3. **Professional confidence in recommending this questionnaire to stakeholders**
