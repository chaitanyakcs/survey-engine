# Railway Deployment with RFQ Cancellation Support

This guide ensures that the RFQ cancellation functionality works properly in Railway production environment.

## Overview

The RFQ cancellation feature requires a database constraint update to allow the `'cancelled'` status in the `document_uploads.processing_status` field. This guide covers:

1. Database migration deployment
2. Verification of constraint updates
3. Testing cancellation functionality
4. Troubleshooting common issues

## Database Migration

### Migration Files

The following migration files handle the constraint update:

1. **`migrations/012_add_document_uploads.sql`** - Initial migration
2. **`migrations/016_fix_duplicate_rules_with_fk_handling.sql`** - Fixed migration

### Migration Process

The migration is automatically applied during Railway deployment via the admin API system:

```bash
# In deploy.sh, the migration is handled via admin endpoints:
curl -X POST https://your-app.railway.app/api/v1/admin/migrate-all
```

### Manual Migration (if needed)

If automatic migration fails, you can run it manually:

```bash
# Run migration via admin API
curl -X POST https://your-app.railway.app/api/v1/admin/migrate-all

# Verify migration status
curl https://your-app.railway.app/api/v1/admin/check-migration-status
```

## Verification Script

### Running Verification

Use the provided verification script to ensure the constraint is properly applied:

```bash
# Run verification script
python3 scripts/verify_railway_migration.py
```

### Expected Output

```

## Testing Cancellation in Railway

### 1. Test Backend API

```bash
# Test cancellation endpoint
curl -X POST https://your-railway-app.railway.app/api/v1/rfq/cancel/test-session-id

# Expected response:
{
  "status": "cancelled",
  "session_id": "test-session-id",
  "message": "Document processing cancelled successfully"
}
```

### 2. Test Status Endpoint

```bash
# Check status after cancellation
curl https://your-railway-app.railway.app/api/v1/rfq/status/test-session-id

# Expected response:
{
  "status": "cancelled",
  "session_id": "test-session-id",
  "processing_status": "cancelled",
  "error_message": "Processing cancelled by user",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-04T20:30:00.000Z",
  "message": "Document processing cancelled by user"
}
```

### 3. Test Frontend Integration

1. Upload a document in the RFQ editor
2. Wait for processing to start
3. Click "Cancel Processing" button
4. Verify:
   - Form resets to document upload section
   - Polling stops
   - Success toast appears
   - No backend errors in logs

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. Constraint Not Updated

**Symptoms:**
- `CheckViolation` error when trying to cancel
- Backend logs show constraint violation

**Solution:**
```bash
# Check migration status via admin API
curl https://your-app.railway.app/api/v1/admin/check-migration-status

# If migration is needed, run:
curl -X POST https://your-app.railway.app/api/v1/admin/migrate-all

# Verify constraint manually
psql $DATABASE_URL -c "SELECT constraint_name, check_clause FROM information_schema.check_constraints WHERE constraint_name = 'check_processing_status';"
```

#### 2. Migration Fails in Railway

**Symptoms:**
- Railway deployment fails during migration
- Database connection issues

**Solution:**
1. Check Railway database connection
2. Ensure `DATABASE_URL` is properly set
3. Run migration manually via Railway CLI
4. Check Railway logs for specific errors

#### 3. Frontend Cancellation Not Working

**Symptoms:**
- Cancel button doesn't respond
- Polling continues after cancellation
- Form doesn't reset

**Solution:**
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify API endpoints are accessible
3. Check network tab for failed requests
4. Ensure frontend is using correct API base URL

### Debug Commands

```bash
# Check database constraint
psql $DATABASE_URL -c "SELECT constraint_name, check_clause FROM information_schema.check_constraints WHERE constraint_name = 'check_processing_status';"

# Check migration status via admin API
curl https://your-app.railway.app/api/v1/admin/check-migration-status

# Run migrations if needed
curl -X POST https://your-app.railway.app/api/v1/admin/migrate-all

# Test constraint manually
psql $DATABASE_URL -c "INSERT INTO document_uploads (session_id, filename, file_size, processing_status, created_at) VALUES ('test', 'test.docx', 1024, 'cancelled', NOW()) ON CONFLICT (session_id) DO NOTHING;"

# Clean up test
psql $DATABASE_URL -c "DELETE FROM document_uploads WHERE session_id = 'test';"
```

## Monitoring

### Railway Logs

Monitor Railway logs for:
- Migration success/failure messages
- Database connection issues
- API endpoint errors
- Constraint violation errors

### Health Checks

The application includes health check endpoints:
- `/health` - Basic health check
- `/api/health` - API health check

### Database Monitoring

Monitor database for:
- Constraint violations
- Failed migrations
- Connection issues
- Performance impact

## Rollback Plan

If issues arise, you can rollback the migration:

```bash
# Check migration status
curl https://your-app.railway.app/api/v1/admin/check-migration-status

# Note: SQL migrations are idempotent and can be run multiple times safely
# If you need to rollback specific changes, you would need to create a new migration

# Test that 'cancelled' status is rejected (if rollback was needed)
psql $DATABASE_URL -c "INSERT INTO document_uploads (session_id, filename, file_size, processing_status, created_at) VALUES ('test', 'test.docx', 1024, 'cancelled', NOW());"
# This should fail with constraint violation if rollback was successful
```

## Success Criteria

‚úÖ **Migration Applied**: Constraint includes 'cancelled' status  
‚úÖ **API Working**: Cancellation endpoint responds correctly  
‚úÖ **Frontend Working**: Cancel button stops polling and resets form  
‚úÖ **Database Updated**: Records can be marked as 'cancelled'  
‚úÖ **No Errors**: No constraint violations in logs
