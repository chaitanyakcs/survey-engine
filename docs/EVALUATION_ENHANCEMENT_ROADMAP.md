## 🗓️ **IMPLEMENTATION PHASES**

## **PHASE 1: Advanced LLM Reasoning** (Est: 1-2 weeks)
**Goal**: Replace simple scoring with sophisticated chain-of-thought evaluation

### **Tasks Overview**
| Task | Status | Priority | Estimated Time |
|------|--------|----------|----------------|

### **Technical Approach**

#### **Chain-of-Thought Evaluation Process**
```python
# Advanced reasoning pipeline
async def advanced_content_validity_evaluation(self, survey, rfq):
    """
    STEP 1: Extract Research Objectives (Semantic Analysis)
    STEP 2: Map Questions to Objectives (Intent Matching) 
    STEP 3: Identify Coverage Gaps (Gap Analysis)
    STEP 4: Assess Question Quality (Quality Scoring)
    STEP 5: Generate Specific Recommendations (Actionable Output)
    """
```

#### **Multi-Perspective Analysis**
- **Researcher Perspective**: Does this meet research goals?
- **Respondent Perspective**: Is this clear and engaging?
- **Analyst Perspective**: Will this generate actionable insights?

### **Technical Approach**

#### **Recommendation Engine Architecture**
```python
@dataclass
class ActionableRecommendation:
    issue: str
    suggested_questions: List[str]
    pillar: str
    priority: str  # critical, high, medium, low
    impact_score: float  # 0.0-1.0
    implementation_difficulty: str
    expected_improvement: str
    context: str  # RFQ-specific context
```
