-- Migration: Consolidate Quality Rules into Pillar System
-- Created: 2024-01-XX
-- Description: This migration is now empty - pillar rules are managed via API

-- Pillar rules are now managed through the API endpoints and should not be seeded via SQL migrations
-- This prevents duplicate pillar rules from being created during deployment
