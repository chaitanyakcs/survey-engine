a31b9e32-dd81-40da-865d-cee442ffa3c2	Our restaurant chain wants to test different price points for a new plant-based burger option.\n        We're targeting health-conscious consumers who are willing to pay premium prices for quality alternatives.\n        The burger costs $4.50 to make and current menu prices range from $8.99 (basic burger) to $16.99 (premium).\n        We want to test price points between $11.99-$15.99 to find optimal demand curve.\n        Key markets: Urban areas, college towns, health-conscious suburban areas.	{"title": "Plant-Based Burger Pricing Study", "questions":
