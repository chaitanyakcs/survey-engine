Even at n=200 total, analyses would be underpowered for planned segmentation and for stable conjoint utilities across roles/segments. Risks include unstable estimates, wide CIs for part-worths and price thresholds, unreliable MaxDiff scaling, and inconclusive segment comparisons. Insufficient per-segment n will lead to Type II errors, overfitting, and misleading competitive/brand mapping. Remedy requires increasing total completes, prioritizing segments, or reducing analytical scope.",

              "Ensure per-segment minima: aim for \u2265100\u2013150 completes per primary segment (e.g., company size band, industry macro-vertical, tech stack maturity tier) if you need stable within-segment estimates. If crossing segments (e.g., size x industry), ensure \u226575\u2013100 per cell or limit the number of segment cuts.",
              "For Conjoint: target \u2265300 total with balanced representation across key segments or use hierarchical Bayes with design ensuring 8\u201312 tasks per respondent, 3\u20135 concepts per task, level balance, and prohibitions. If segment-level utilities are needed, plan \u2265150 per focal segment or use pooled HB with covariates.",
              "For MaxDiff: n\u2265250 recommended if you require stable segment-level scores; use 8\u201312 sets/respondent, 4\u20135 items per set, ensure item exposure balance.",
              "For PSM: n\u2265200 for overall price ranges and \u2265100 per priority segment if segment-level price thresholds are needed. If also running Gabor-Granger, plan 150+ per price point; this often implies \u2265600 total if testing 4 points with balanced assignment.",
              "Limit segmentation breadth or predefine a small set of priority segments to avoid fragmentation. Alternatively, collect broader sample (n>1,000) if multiple segment intersections are required.",

              "Implement quotas to ensure minimum per role (IT Directors, Business Users, Procurement, C-level): aim \u2265125 per role if role-by-method outputs are required; otherwise \u226575 as a minimum with pooled HB modeling.",
